## ✨ What It Does

- 🔄 Sends continuous `ChatAction` (like typing, uploading, recording, etc.) in chats where someone sends a message  
- 🤹 Supports **multiple bots at once** (via comma-separated tokens)  
- 🧠 Works in **private chats**, **groups**, and **supergroups**  
- ⚙️ Fully async — scales well and is low-resource  
- 🔒 Zero user interaction — runs silently in the background
